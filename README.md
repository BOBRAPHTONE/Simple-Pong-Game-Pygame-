# Simple-Pong-Game-Pygame-
A simple pong game made with python and pygame

This program was originaly created by pygame.org creator Baris Bayrak (garib) 
His Code: http://www.pygame.org/project-Very+simple+Pong+game-816-.html

I just added two players, and a play to 11 win by 2 mechanic

To play (On Mac, sorry for you Windows users, I think you would open it however you open .py files on Windows):

1. Make sure you have Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9 installed

2. Open terminal

3. cd to whichever folder you put the PONG_GAME.py file

4. Type "python PONG_GAME.py" into Terminal and hit enter

5. The game will launch

6. When a player wins, the program will pause

7. Now, you have to go back to Terminal for the win message

8. All done. To play again, repeat from step 4
